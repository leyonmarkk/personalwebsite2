##Research Paper

I have taken two courses in Economic Statistics. The second course involved applying our knowledge to real world applications. Our final project was an empirical modeling research paper. We had to come up with a research question, and I chose to research employment rate within retail trade companies. We had to do a background literature review on the topic, and we had to find data tables to support our methodology. I obtained data from the United States Census Bureau public database. I then ran a regression analysis in Stata, a statistics software. My conclusions can be seen at the end of my paper.
