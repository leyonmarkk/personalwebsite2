## Canva

These are two examples of data visualization that I have created using the tool called Canva. I have previously used Canva to make graphics for when I was the VP of Marketing for a large club on campus. I would create informational flyers and social media posts using the tool. I was interested in learning more about data visualizations, so I tried using Canva to start. I made these two graphics as practice. I used a small set of data that was provided to me by a company. The first is a visualization of their net promoter score survey results. I used a pie chart and a bar chart to break down the results. The second graphic was based on their Customer Relationship Management from the NPS, and showed where they should focus their improvements and what they were doing well.

## Adobe Premiere

I took a course called Digital and Intermedia Art. Throughout this class, we learned how to use the Adobe Creative Suite. We created projects in Premiere Pro, InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. My favorite project I created used Premiere. I did a parody of the opening credits of the TV show “Full House”. I filmed my friend group in the different roles of the cast and aptly named it “Full Dorm”. I edited the clips together, fixed the lighting, added the show’s theme song, and applied the text overlays in the font of the TV show, among other techniques. If anything, it is a fun way to look back on what it is like to live in a college residence hall!
