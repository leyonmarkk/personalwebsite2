## GoPro Marketing Plan

In my Principles of Marketing course, we had to create a full marketing plan for a real company that was assigned to us. This was a group project, so I can not take credit for the whole presentation, but everything was discussed as a group, and each member was integral. We had to do a lot of research on our particular companyâ€™s products and marketing structure. Our company was GoPro, and we focused on their newest product at the time. We used many of the topics we learned in class to apply them to a real world setting. For more information on a breakdown of my specific work, feel free to contact me.

## Trade Area Analysis

In my Advanced Marketing course, our final assignment was to create a trading area analysis for a real city and a real store within that city. I am from Buffalo, NY and much like most people, I like the store Target. I chose to look at Target locations towards the center of the city. I had to research the customer base for the store, and the segments that the location would attract. I also had to research the surrounding area to look at competitors. Location is a crucial part of marketing, so this project was important to my education in marketing.
