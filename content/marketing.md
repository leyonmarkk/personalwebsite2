## GoPro Marketing Plan

In my Principles of Marketing course, we had to create a full marketing plan for a real company that was assigned to us. This was a group project, so I can not take credit for the whole presentation, but everything was discussed as a group, and each member was integral. We had to do a lot of research on our particular companyâ€™s products and marketing structure. Our company was GoPro, and we focused on their newest product at the time. We used many of the topics we learned in class to apply them to a real world setting. For more information on a breakdown of my specific work, feel free to contact me.
